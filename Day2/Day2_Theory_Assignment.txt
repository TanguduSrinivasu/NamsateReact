What is NPM?
NPM is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language.
It consists of a command-line interface and an online database of public packages and private packages that are paid which is called the npm Registry.
NPM is used to install, update, and manage packages (libraries, tools, etc.) that are published on the npm registry.
It is like a Maven to the UI.
We use npm because our React App is powered by lot of things or lot of packages like we need to minify, bundle the things up, remove the unwanted
unwanted code, optimise the app. Inorder to perform these things we need the helper packages which are available from the NPM.
